        <h2>History of Halloween</h2>
        <p>
          Halloween has its origins in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, a time when people
          believed the boundary between the living and the dead became thin. Over centuries,
          traditions from religious observances, folk customs, and harvest festivals merged to form
          the modern celebration we know today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the Middle Ages and later with migrations to North America, Halloween adopted
          new customs: trick-or-treating, carving pumpkins, and costume parties. These practices
          evolved regionally and continue to change with modern culture.
